        <h3>What I have learnt So far</h3>
        <p>I have learnt about <strong>Git</strong> which is a <em>version control system </em> using the command line, and also pushing our work to github.</p>
        <p>I also learnt about <strong>HTML</strong> which is known as <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, it is the structure of the webpage. I also learnt about html structures, tags, attributes and  html elements such as the headings (h1-h6), paragraph(p tag), lists,html tables, forms, anchor (a)tag, img tag.</p>
        <p>We were introduced to <strong>CSS</strong> this week, which is known as <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em>. it is used for styling the webpage. I learnt about the 3 ways of styling our html page which are <strong>Inline Css, Internal Css and External Css.</strong> The inline css is when you add your css styling in the opening tag of your html elements as style attribute while the internal css is when you add your CSS using style tag inside of the head element and external css is when you open a different file named .css and you add a link to it in the head section of each HTML page.
        </p>
        <p>I also learnt about the Css selectors and its types which are universal selector, element selector, class selector, id selector and attribute selector, I also learnt about the css specificity and inheritance, css box model and types of box model which are block level model and inline level model. I was able to understand the box model using padding, margin and border.</p>
        <h3>Importance of CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS is important in the design of a webpage because it controls all design-related aspects of a website such as topography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of a website. it also creates a great user experience.   </p>

        <h3>Difference between paddings, margins and borders</h3>
        <p><strong>Padding </strong>is the <em>inner space between the content and the border of your box</em></p>
        <p><strong>Border</strong> is the <em>perimeter of the box</em>, it can be invisible or it could be a thick colored line.</p>
        <p><strong>Margin</strong> is the <em> outer space surrounding the box </em>i.e the space between the border and outer elements.   </p>
